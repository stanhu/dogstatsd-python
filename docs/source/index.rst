================


.. automodule:: statsd

    .. autoclass:: DogStatsd
       :members:

.. module:: statsd
.. data:: statsd

    A global :class:`~statsd.DogStatsd` instance that is easily shared
    across an application's modules. Initialize this once in your application's
    set-up code and then other modules can import and use it without further
    configuration.

    >>> from dogstatsd import statsd
    >>> statsd.connect(host='localhost', port=8125)
